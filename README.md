This was a practice to help me learn Node.js and get comfortable before completeing the players-api-skeleton challenge.

I created a REST API that allows uesers to create accounts (with user security and authentication) to add, edit, and delete Players that they create.  I used:
  --  MongoDB -> to persist user and play info
  --  Mongoose -> library that made it easy to wrk with mongoDB
  --  express -> a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile      applications.
  --  lodash -> makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc.
  --  body-parser -> Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers
  --  bcryptjs -> password hashing function
  --  jsonwebtoken -> encodes password into a string of characters which is safe to I/O. The token represents a value that is accessible only by the computer that has access to the secret key with which it was encrypted. 
  --  validator -> way of validating javascript objects.
